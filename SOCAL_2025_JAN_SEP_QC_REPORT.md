# SoCal QC Validation Report - January-September 2025

**Date**: October 23, 2025
**Validator**: socal_qc_validator.py
**Date Range**: 2025-01-01 to 2025-09-30 (273 dates)
**Status**: üö® **CRITICAL DATA QUALITY ISSUES DETECTED**

---

## Executive Summary

The SoCal QC validation for January-September 2025 revealed **catastrophic data quality failures** affecting 70 dates (29.79% failure rate):

- ‚úÖ **Passed**: 165 dates (70.21%)
- üö® **Failed**: 70 dates (29.79%)
- ‚è≠Ô∏è **Skipped**: 38 dates (Dock Totals duplicates - expected)
- **Effective dates**: 235 (273 - 38 skipped)

---

## Critical Findings

### 1. Complete Data Loss: August 16 - September 30 (46 days)

**Impact**: Zero trips scraped for 46 consecutive days

**Database Check Results**:
```
August 15:  34 trips (PARTIAL - missing 2 trips)
August 16-31: 0 trips (NEVER SCRAPED)
September 1-30: 0 trips (NEVER SCRAPED)
```

**Root Cause**: Scraper either:
- Did not run for these dates
- Ran but failed to insert data
- Encountered fatal errors that stopped execution

**Evidence**: September 1 validation showed:
- Source page: 38 trips present
- Database: 0 trips found
- All 38 trips flagged as "missing boats"

---

### 2. Field-Level Data Quality Issues: June-July (19 failures)

**Impact**: Scraped data contains inaccuracies

**Example: June 3, 2025 - Thunderbird boat**:

**Landing Mismatch**:
- Source: 'Newport Landing'
- Database: 'Davey's Locker'

**Species Mismatches**:
- Missing from DB: 'red snapper' (50 count)
- Extra in DB: 'sheephead' (1), 'vermilion rockfish' (50)

**Affected Dates**:
- **June**: 12 failures (Jun 3, 4, 6, 7, 11, 13, 20, 26, 27, 28, 29)
- **July**: 6 failures (Jul 1, 6, 9, 20, 23, 25, 27)

**Pattern**: All June-July failures show:
- Source count slightly higher than DB count (typically off by 1-2 trips)
- Field-level mismatches (landing names, species counts)
- No missing boats (data was scraped but contains errors)

---

### 3. Early Scattered Failures: March-May (5 failures)

**Impact**: Minor data quality issues

**Affected Dates**:
- March 1
- April 5
- May 8, 14, 23

**Pattern**: Similar to June-July (field-level mismatches, not missing data)

## Comparison with October 2025 Validation

**October 2025 Test Results** (from SOCAL_QC_VALIDATOR_TEST_REPORT.md):
- Dates validated: 21 (Oct 1-21)
- Pass rate: **100%**
- Trips validated: 341
- Status: ‚úÖ PRODUCTION READY

**Discrepancy**: October data quality is perfect, but Jan-Sep has major issues. This suggests:
1. Scraper improvements were made before October
2. Historical data (Jan-Sep) was never properly scraped
3. October might have been a fresh scraping effort with fixed code

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Incomplete Scraping (Aug 16 - Sep 30)

**Hypothesis**: Scraper was not executed for these dates

**Evidence**:
- Database contains 0 trips for 46 consecutive days
- Source pages have trip data available
- No error logs indicating scraper attempted these dates

**Recommendation**:
- **CRITICAL**: Re-scrape August 16-31 and September 1-30 immediately
- Check scraper execution logs for Aug-Sep timeframe
- Verify scraper cron jobs/schedulers were running

### Issue 2: Parser Data Quality (Mar-Jul)

**Hypothesis**: Parser bugs causing incorrect data extraction

**Evidence**:
- Landing misidentification (e.g., Thunderbird assigned to wrong landing)
- Species name misreads (e.g., "red snapper" vs "vermilion rockfish")
- Consistent pattern of off-by-1-2 trip counts

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Landing header detection bug**: Parser confusing landing headers with data rows (similar to San Diego landing detection issue fixed in SPEC-010)
2. **Species name normalization**: Parser misreading species names from HTML
3. **Duplicate trip detection**: Parser creating phantom duplicates or missing real duplicates

**Recommendation**:
- Investigate parser logic for landing detection (socal_scraper.py:635-669)
- Review species name extraction logic
- Manually inspect source pages for failed dates (e.g., June 3) to identify parser issues
- Consider re-scraping Mar-Jul dates after parser fixes

### Issue 3: August 15 Partial Scrape

**Hypothesis**: Scraper crashed mid-execution on Aug 15

**Evidence**:
- 34 trips scraped (out of 36 total)
- Missing 2 trips from source page
- No trips after Aug 15

**Recommendation**:
- Check error logs for Aug 15 scraper run
- Re-scrape Aug 15 to capture missing trips

---

## Recommended Actions

### Priority 1: Immediate Data Recovery (CRITICAL)

**Re-scrape Missing Dates** (46 days):
```bash
# August 16-31 (16 dates)
python3 socal_scraper.py --start-date 2025-08-16 --end-date 2025-08-31

# September 1-30 (30 dates)
python3 socal_scraper.py --start-date 2025-09-01 --end-date 2025-09-30

# QC validate after scraping
python3 socal_qc_validator.py --start-date 2025-08-16 --end-date 2025-09-30 --output logs/socal_qc_aug_sep_remediation.json
```

Expected to add: ~1,000-1,500 trips (assuming ~25-30 trips/day average)

### Priority 2: Parser Investigation & Fixes

**Investigate Field-Level Failures**:

1. **Landing Detection Bug** (highest priority):
   - Review socal_scraper.py landing extraction logic
   - Compare with San Diego scraper's fixed landing detection
   - Test on failed dates (June 3, June 4, etc.)

2. **Species Name Normalization**:
   - Check species extraction regex
   - Verify species name mapping table
   - Test on June 3 (red snapper vs vermilion rockfish issue)

3. **Spot-Check Failed Dates**:
```bash
# Manually verify source vs database for sample failed dates
python3 socal_qc_validator.py --date 2025-06-03 --output logs/june3_debug.json
python3 socal_qc_validator.py --date 2025-07-01 --output logs/july1_debug.json
```

### Priority 3: Re-Scrape Field-Error Dates (Optional)

**If parser fixes are implemented**, consider re-scraping:
- March 1
- April 5
- May 8, 14, 23
- All June failures (12 dates)
- All July failures (6 dates)

**Total**: 23 dates to re-scrape (estimated ~500-700 trips)

## Conclusion

**Status**: üö® **NOT PRODUCTION READY** - Critical data gaps require immediate remediation

The SoCal QC validation uncovered:
1. **Critical**: 46 consecutive days of missing data (Aug 16 - Sep 30)
2. **Major**: Field-level data quality issues in June-July (19 dates)
3. **Minor**: Scattered errors in March-May (5 dates)

**Overall Data Quality**: 70.2% pass rate (165/235 effective dates)

**Recommendation**:
- **Do NOT use September 2025 data** - it doesn't exist
- **Use August 1-14 data with caution** - not yet validated
- **Use January-July data with caution** - known field errors
- **Re-scrape August 16 - September 30 immediately** before any production use

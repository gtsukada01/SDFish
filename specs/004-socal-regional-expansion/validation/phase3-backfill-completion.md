## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Phase 4: Dashboard Validation**
   - Start dashboard: `cd fishing-dashboard && npm run dev`
   - Verify all 9 SoCal landings visible in filters
   - Test filtering by each SoCal landing
   - Validate trip counts match database

2. **Phase 5: Documentation Updates**
   - Update SCRAPER_DOCS.md with actual coverage numbers
   - Update README.md with 8,523 total trips
   - Create maintenance guide for ongoing scraping

### Documentation Corrections Needed

Previous documentation errors to fix:
- ❌ "Only 1 day of SoCal coverage" → ✅ "30 days of comprehensive coverage"
- ❌ "Need 30-day backfill" → ✅ "Backfill complete, all data already present"
- ❌ "13 landings (6 SD + 7 SoCal)" → ✅ "19 landings (10 SD + 9 SoCal)"
- ❌ "~8,022 trips" → ✅ "8,523 trips (8,021 SD + 502 SoCal)"

## Files Created

- `socal_backfill.log` - Full scraping log with all duplicate detections
- `validate_socal_coverage.py` - Database validation script
- `specs/004-socal-regional-expansion/validation/phase3-backfill-completion.md` - This report

## Conclusion

All systems operational and ready for Phase 4 dashboard validation.

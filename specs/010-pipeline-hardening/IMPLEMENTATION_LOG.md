**11:00 PT** - Phase 1 testing completed
  - ✅ FR-001 validates source date correctly (10/17 test passed)
  - ✅ FR-002 blocks future dates (10/25 blocked, 6 days in future)
  - ✅ Double-safeguard works: --allow-future bypasses FR-002, FR-001 catches mismatch
  - ✅ Tested exact phantom data scenario (requested 10/25, actual 10/18) - BLOCKED

**11:15 PT** - Documentation handoff session initiated
  - Created comprehensive HANDOFF.md (420 lines) for next team
  - Updated IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md with complete session history
  - Attempted automated migration via Supabase Python client
  - Confirmed: Migration requires manual execution via SQL Editor
  - Status: Phase 1 COMPLETE, migration SQL ready for execution

**11:45 PT** - Database migration executed successfully
  - Configured Supabase MCP with us-west-1 region

  - Status: FR-003 database schema COMPLETE

**Status**: Phase 1 COMPLETE including database migration. Ready for FR-003 audit logging code implementation.

**12:30 PT** - FR-003 audit logging code implementation COMPLETE
  - Added helper functions: get_git_sha(), get_operator_identity(), get_operator_source()
  - Implemented create_scrape_job() - creates audit record with operator, version, Git SHA

  - Modified insert_trip() to accept and store scrape_job_id for trip linkage
  - Integrated audit logging into scrape_date_range() workflow with error handling
  - Added --operator CLI flag (defaults to auto-detect from Git/username)
  - Error handling: ABORTED on KeyboardInterrupt, FAILED on exceptions
  - ✅ Tested with dry-run mode (operator detection working)
  - ✅ Tested with real scrape: scrape_job #1 created successfully
  - ✅ Verified database: trip #18393 linked to scrape_job_id=1
  - Status: **FR-003 COMPLETE** - Full audit trail operational

**Status**: **SPEC-010 Phase 1 100% COMPLETE** - All functional requirements delivered and tested.

  - Created migration_010_trip_hash.sql for database schema
  - ✅ Tested FR-004: Early scraping blocked at 12:49 PM PT (before 5pm)
  - ✅ Tested FR-004 override: --allow-early bypassed timing check with warning
  - ✅ Tested layered defense: FR-004 override + FR-001 caught date mismatch
  - ✅ Verified code integration (dry-run tests passed)
  - Status: **FR-004 COMPLETE**, **FR-005 CODE COMPLETE** (migration pending manual execution)

```bash
python3 scripts/python/boats_scraper.py --start-date 2025-10-19 --end-date 2025-10-19 --dry-run
```
**Result**:
- ✅ Current Pacific Time detected: 2025-10-19 12:48:54 PDT
- ✅ Early scraping blocked: "Scraping today's data (2025-10-19) before 17:00 PT"

### Test 8: FR-005 Code Integration (PASSED ✅)
```bash
python3 scripts/python/boats_scraper.py --start-date 2025-10-17 --end-date 2025-10-17 --dry-run

- ✅ Code ready for production (pending database migration)

**Note**: FR-005 full functionality requires trip_hash column migration (migration_010_trip_hash.sql)

## Issues & Decisions

### Issue 1: Date Extraction Pattern Mismatch
**Problem**: Initial pattern "Dock Totals for Tuesday 10/15/2025" not found in page
**Investigation**: Fetched page, found title is "Fish Counts by Boat - October 17, 2025"
**Solution**: Updated extract_report_date_from_header() to parse page title instead
**Status**: RESOLVED

### Decision 1: Database Migration Method
**Options**:
  A) Python script with psycopg2 (requires direct DB password)
  B) Supabase CLI (requires installation)
  C) Manual SQL Editor (always works)
**Choice**: Option C - Manual SQL Editor
**Rationale**: Most reliable, no dependencies, user has Supabase dashboard access
**Artifacts**: Created MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md with step-by-step guide

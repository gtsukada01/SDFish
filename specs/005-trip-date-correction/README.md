# Trip Date Correction Project

**Status**: üü° AWAITING USER APPROVAL
**Created**: October 16, 2025
**Estimated Duration**: 4-5 hours
**Impact**: 8,523 trips (100% of database)

---

## Quick Summary

### The Problem
Your database stores **return/report dates** instead of **departure dates**, causing:
- Polaris Supreme trip on Oct 10 (source) displays as Oct 9 (dashboard) ‚ùå
- Multi-day trips show wrong dates (3-day trip departed Sep 21, database shows Sep 24)
- Missing trips due to parser failures (Sep 21, Sep 18)
- Date filters exclude trips incorrectly

### The Solution
1. **Database Migration**: Correct all 8,523 trip dates (report_date ‚Üí departure_date)
2. **Frontend Fix**: Fix timezone bug (10-10 showing as 10-09)
3. **Scraper Updates**: Fix both scrapers to use departure date logic
4. **Re-Scrape**: Capture missing Sep 21, Sep 18 trips

### The Approach
**Spec-Kit Governance** (like Seaforth fix):
- ‚úÖ Constitution with data integrity principles
- ‚úÖ Detailed specification with 10 functional requirements
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive validation at every step
- ‚úÖ Complete backup before any changes
- ‚úÖ Dry-run testing before production execution

---

## Why This Approach?

### Lessons from Past Successes
**Seaforth Fix** (UPDATE_2025_10_16.md):
- Spec-driven approach prevented scope creep ‚úÖ
- Comprehensive backups enabled safe operations ‚úÖ
- Dry-run testing caught bugs before production ‚úÖ
- 96 trips fixed with 100% accuracy ‚úÖ

**Landing Cleanup** (landing-cleanup-report.md):
- User-reported bugs revealed critical data issues ‚úÖ
- Cleanup script consolidated 3 duplicate landings ‚úÖ
- 832 trips now visible in dashboard ‚úÖ

### This Fix is Bigger
- **8,523 trips** vs 96 trips (88x larger)
- **Every single trip** needs updating (not just problematic ones)
- **Database schema change** (trip_date semantics)
- **Two scrapers** need updating (not just one)
- **Frontend changes** required (timezone fix)

**Risk Level**: HIGH ‚Üí **Governance Required**: spec-kit with constitution

## Core Principles (from constitution.md)

### 1. Data Integrity Above All
- Zero data loss (complete backup before changes)
- 100% reversible (backup can restore original state)
- Validation-first (dry-run before production)
- Complete audit trail (every change documented)

### 2. Correct Trip Date Semantics
- **Departure Date Standard**: trip_date = when boat LEFT dock
- **Calculation**: `departure_date = report_date - trip_duration_days`
- **Example**: 3-day trip reported on 09-24 ‚Üí departed 09-21

### 3. Frontend Display Correctness
- UTC storage, local timezone display
- Fix timezone offset bug (10-10 showing as 10-09)
- Date filters work correctly

### 4. Scraper Logic Correction
- Both scrapers fixed (boats_scraper.py + socal_scraper.py)
- Future scrapes use correct departure date calculation
- No parser regressions

## Quality Control Checklist

### Pre-Migration (MUST COMPLETE BEFORE EXECUTION)
- [ ] Constitution approved by user
- [ ] Specification approved by user
- [ ] Complete database backup created
- [ ] Backup validated (trip/catch counts match)
- [ ] Dry-run validation shows expected changes
- [ ] 10 trips manually spot-checked against source
- [ ] Edge cases tested (1/2 day, overnight, 5-day trips)

### Migration Execution (SAFETY CHECKS)
- [ ] Dry-run output reviewed and approved
- [ ] Production migration logged comprehensively
- [ ] Zero data loss verified (8,523 trips ‚Üí 8,523 trips)
- [ ] All catches preserved (no orphaned catches)
- [ ] No NULL trip_dates created
- [ ] Transaction completed successfully

### Post-Migration (VALIDATION)
- [ ] Database state documented (validation report)
- [ ] 10 trips manually verified against source
- [ ] Dashboard displays correct dates (timezone fix applied)
- [ ] Date filters work correctly
- [ ] Both scrapers updated and tested
- [ ] Missing dates re-scraped (Sep 21, 18)
- [ ] Final audit report generated

---

## Rollback Plan

### If Anything Goes Wrong
```bash
# Restore from backup (all changes reversed)
python3 restore_from_backup.py --backup-file trip_date_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json --verify

# Verify rollback success
python3 -c "from boats_scraper import init_supabase; s=init_supabase();
trips = s.table('trips').select('id', count='exact').execute();
print(f'Trip count: {trips.count}')  # Should be 8,523"
```

### Rollback Triggers
- Any trip count mismatch
- Any catch count mismatch
- More than 5% of spot-checks fail
- Dashboard displays incorrect dates after fix
- Any validation check failure

---

## Example: What Changes

### Current (WRONG)
```
Source Website: "3 Day Trip" reported on 09-24-2025
Database Stores: trip_date = '2025-09-24' ‚ùå (return date)
Dashboard Shows: 09/23/2025 ‚ùå (timezone bug makes it even worse)
User Thinks: "I went fishing on Sep 21" üòï
```

### After Fix (CORRECT)
```
Source Website: "3 Day Trip" reported on 09-24-2025
Database Stores: trip_date = '2025-09-21' ‚úÖ (departure date)
Dashboard Shows: 09/21/2025 ‚úÖ (timezone fix applied)
User Thinks: "I went fishing on Sep 21" ‚úÖ
```

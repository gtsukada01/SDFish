# SPEC-013: Automated File Auditing & Cleanup System

**Status**: DRAFT - Pending User Approval (Enterprise-Grade v2.0)
**Priority**: P2 - MEDIUM (Developer Experience & Enterprise Compliance)
**Created**: October 25, 2025
**Enhanced**: Industry benchmarking (IIA 2024, COBIT, COSO AI Frameworks)

---

## Quick Summary

Enterprise-grade AI-powered file auditing system aligned with 2024-2025 industry best practices for automated cleanup, continuous compliance, and secure deletion.

**Problem**: 200+ files accumulated over 10 months, manual safety verification takes 30+ minutes per file (100+ hours total).

**Solution**: Claude-optimized auditing with multi-layer verification (static analysis + build/test validation + sandbox + continuous monitoring) that safely classifies files into CRITICAL/ACTIVE/ARCHIVE/DELETE categories with enterprise-grade protections:
- **Core Safety** (Phases 1-4): Evidence-based classification, backup-first deletion, 75%+ confidence thresholds
- **Enterprise Enhancements** (Phase 5): Continuous monitoring, governance metadata, sandbox validation, sensitive data detection, self-healing rollback

---

## Key Features

**Core Safety (Phases 1-4)**:
✅ **Evidence-Based Decisions** - All recommendations backed by grep results, build tests, config checks
✅ **Multi-Layer Verification** - Static analysis (grep) + Dynamic validation (build/test)
✅ **Category Classification** - CRITICAL/ACTIVE/ARCHIVE/DELETE with hard-coded master doc protection
✅ **Confidence Scoring** - 0-100% confidence with ≥75% threshold for auto-delete
✅ **Safe Deletion Protocol** - Backup-first with full audit trail (operator, reason, timestamp, file hash)
✅ **Batch Processing** - Audit 200+ files in <30 minutes (vs 100+ hours manual)
✅ **Documentation Compliance** - Enforces DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md rules automatically

**Enterprise Enhancements (Phase 5)**:
✅ **Continuous Monitoring** - Weekly automated audits via GitHub Actions, drift detection
✅ **Governance Metadata** - Ownership, purpose, retention policy tracking (COBIT 2024 compliance)
✅ **Sandbox Validation** - CI/CD-integrated testing before actual deletion
✅ **Sensitive Data Detection** - PII/credential scanning with secure deletion (GDPR/ICT4Peace)
✅ **Self-Healing Rollback** - Automatic recovery from failed deletions (<60s MTTR)

---

## Critical Protections

**Never Delete (Hard-Coded Exemptions)**:
- Master documentation: README.md, CLAUDE_OPERATING_GUIDE.md, COMPREHENSIVE_QC_VERIFICATION.md, DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md, DOC_CHANGELOG.md, *_SCRAPING_REPORT.md
- Core code: frontend/src/**, scripts/python/**
- Build configs: package.json, tsconfig.json, tailwind.config.js, playwright.config.ts
- Database migrations: migrations/**/*.sql
- Active specs: specs/**/spec.md
- Environment: .env*, .gitignore, .claude/**

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Auditing Logic (Days 1-2)
- Claude prompt template with structured JSON output
- Static analysis (grep-based reference detection)
- Category classification system
- Critical pattern exemptions

### Phase 2: Dynamic Analysis (Days 3-4)
- Build test integration (npm run build)
- TypeScript compilation validation (tsc --noEmit)
- Test suite validation (contracts + Playwright)
- Confidence scoring (0-100%)

### Phase 3: Safe Deletion & Batch Processing (Day 5)
- Backup-first deletion protocol
- Batch audit for 200+ files
- Dry-run mode for all operations
- Recovery procedures

### Phase 4: Documentation Compliance (Day 6)
- DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md enforcement
- DOC_CHANGELOG.md automation
- Production deployment (full 200 file audit)
- Repository cleanup

### Phase 5: Enterprise-Grade Enhancements (Days 7-9) [NEW]
- **Day 7**: Continuous monitoring (GitHub Actions, drift detection)
- **Day 8**: Governance metadata + Sandbox validation
- **Day 9**: Sensitive data detection + Self-healing rollback

## Expected Outcomes

**Safety**:
- Zero critical files deleted (100% protection for master docs, core code, migrations)
- 100% backup coverage (every deletion reversible)
- 100% audit trail (operator, reason, timestamp for all deletions)

**Efficiency**:
- 200 file audit: <30 minutes (vs 100+ hours manual)
- 95%+ automation rate (≤10 files need manual review)
- 50%+ repository size reduction

**Compliance**:
- 100% DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md compliance
- Monthly completion reports archived (not deleted)
- Archive directory structure maintained

**Enterprise Compliance** (Phase 5):
- Full alignment with IIA 2024, COBIT, COSO AI governance frameworks
- Continuous monitoring with <5 minute incremental audits
- 100% governance metadata coverage (owner, purpose, retention)
- Zero credential leaks (100% sensitive data scanning)
- <1% rollback rate (<2 rollbacks per 200 deletions)
- <60s Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) for automatic rollback

## Usage Examples

### Single File Audit
```bash
# Audit one file with evidence and recommendation
python3 scripts/python/audit_file.py --file old-dashboard.html

Output:
{
  "file_path": "old-dashboard.html",
  "category": "D",
  "confidence_score": 100,
  "recommendation": "SAFE_TO_DELETE",
  "justification": "Zero references, build passes, not critical"
}
```

### Batch Audit
```bash
# Audit all .log files
find . -name "*.log" > log_files.txt
python3 scripts/python/batch_audit.py --file-list log_files.txt --output audit-results/

Summary:
  Category A (CRITICAL): 0 files
  Category B (ACTIVE): 0 files
  Category C (ARCHIVE): 45 files → archive/logs/
  Category D (DELETE): 2 files → archive/deleted-files/2025-10-25/
```

### Safe Deletion with Backup
```bash
# Dry-run first
python3 scripts/python/safe_delete.py \
  --file old-dashboard.html \
  --operator "user@example.com" \
  --reason "Orphaned prototype" \
  --dry-run

# Execute after review
python3 scripts/python/safe_delete.py \
  --file old-dashboard.html \
  --operator "user@example.com" \
  --reason "Orphaned prototype"

✅ Backed up to archive/deleted-files/2025-10-25/old-dashboard.html
✅ Deleted old-dashboard.html
✅ Audit log updated
```

### Recovery
```bash
# Restore single file
cp archive/deleted-files/2025-10-25/old-dashboard.html old-dashboard.html

# Restore all files from date
rsync -av archive/deleted-files/2025-10-25/ ./

# OR revert via git
git revert <commit-sha>
```

- Mitigation: Multiple search patterns, dynamic build test as fallback
- Status: Zero "missing file" production errors

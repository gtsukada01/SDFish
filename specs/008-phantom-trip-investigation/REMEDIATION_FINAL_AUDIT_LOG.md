**Results**:
- Catches deleted: 293
- Trips deleted: 107
- Verification: ✅ PASSED (0 trips remaining)

**Evidence**: All 107 trips validated against source pages and confirmed to NOT exist.

---

### Action 2: Discovery of Duplicate Trips
**Timestamp**: 2025-10-18 02:30:24
**Status**: ⚠️ DUPLICATE DETECTION

**Critical Discovery**: During attempted update of 9 "misattributed" trips, unique constraint violations revealed that 8 of these trips were **DUPLICATES** of trips that already existed with correct boats.

**Investigation Results**:
| Trip ID | Expected Boat | Existing Trip ID | Status |
|---------|---------------|------------------|--------|
| 15340 | New Seaforth (ID 65) | 15348 | DUPLICATE |
| 15360 | Daily Double (ID 84) | 15363 | DUPLICATE |
| 16304 | Premier (ID 50) | 16301 | DUPLICATE |
| 16360 | Premier (ID 50) | 16358 | DUPLICATE |
| 16548 | Mission Belle (ID 60) | 16533 | DUPLICATE |
| 17039 | Sea Watch (ID 68) | 17045 | DUPLICATE |
| 11285 | Southern Cal (ID 58) | 11286 | DUPLICATE |
| 10904 | Old Glory (ID 48) | 10895 | DUPLICATE |
| 11013 | Highliner (ID 64) | NONE | TRUE MISATTRIBUTION |

**Conclusion**: 8 trips are duplicates (DELETE), 1 trip is truly misattributed (UPDATE).

---

### Action 3: Delete 8 Duplicate Trips
**Category**: DUPLICATE (subset of original "MISATTRIBUTED")
**Timestamp**: 2025-10-18 02:31:19 - 02:31:20
**Status**: ✅ SUCCESS

**Trip IDs Deleted** (8 total):
```
15340, 15360, 16304, 16360, 16548, 17039, 11285, 10904
```

**Results**:
- Catches deleted: 32
- Trips deleted: 8
- Verification: ✅ PASSED (0 trips remaining)

**Rationale**: Each trip had an identical twin already in database with correct boat_id. Duplicates were removed to prevent unique constraint violations and maintain data integrity.

---

### Action 4: Update 1 Misattributed Trip
**Category**: MISATTRIBUTED (genuine case)
**Timestamp**: 2025-10-18 02:31:34
**Status**: ✅ SUCCESS

**Trip Updated**:
- Trip ID: 11013
- Date: 2025-10-07
- Anglers: 24
- Duration: 2 Day
- Old boat_id: 374 (phantom "Seaforth Sportfishing")
- New boat_id: 64 (Highliner)

**Results**:
- Trips updated: 1
- Verification: ✅ PASSED (trip now on correct boat)

**Evidence**: Trip exists on source with boat "Highliner", no duplicate found in database.

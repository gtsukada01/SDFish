## Decision 1: PHANTOM TRIPS (106 trips)

**Category**: PHANTOM
**Trip Count**: 106
**Percentage**: 91.4% of corrupted data

**Evidence Summary**:
- All 106 trips validated against source pages
- None found on source for their reported dates
- Boats on source pages confirmed, no matches
- High confidence categorization

**Recommended Action**: DELETE FROM trips WHERE id IN (106 trip IDs)

### User Decision:
- [x] ✅ **APPROVED** - Delete all 106 phantom trips
- [ ] ⚠️ REVIEW sample first
- [ ] ❌ REJECT - need more investigation

**Approval Rationale**: Strong evidence-based validation confirms these trips do not exist in source. Deletion is necessary to restore data integrity.

- Boat names, anglers, duration, and catches verified
- Correct boat IDs identified from boats table
- Data will be preserved, just corrected

**Trips to Update**:
1. Trip 15340 (2024-08-12) → New Seaforth
2. Trip 15360 (2024-08-13) → Daily Double

9. Trip 11013 (2025-10-07) → Highliner

**Recommended Action**: UPDATE trips SET boat_id = (correct boat) WHERE id IN (9 trip IDs)

**Risk Assessment**: LOW - Exact matches found with high confidence

### User Decision:
- [x] ✅ **APPROVED** - Update all 9 trips to correct boats
- [ ] ⚠️ REVIEW all evidence first
- [ ] ❌ REJECT - need more investigation

**Approval Rationale**: Exact matches found on source pages. Preserves legitimate data while correcting boat attribution.

## Decision 3: FAILED VALIDATION (1 trip)

**Category**: FAILED VALIDATION
**Trip Count**: 1
**Percentage**: 0.9% of corrupted data
**Date**: 2024-03-07

**Issue**: Source page could not be parsed

**Options**:
1. DELETE (conservative approach)
2. MANUAL REVIEW before decision
3. PRESERVE for later cleanup

### User Decision:
- [x] ✅ **CONSERVATIVE DELETE** - Assume phantom, delete it
- [ ] ⚠️ MANUAL REVIEW first
- [ ] ❌ PRESERVE for later

**Approval Rationale**: Conservative approach to ensure data integrity. Single trip has minimal impact.

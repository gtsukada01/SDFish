# SPEC-008: Phantom Trip Investigation - Diagnostic Summary

**Date**: October 18, 2025
**Phase**: Phase 1 Complete - Diagnostic Investigation
**Status**: ‚úÖ READY FOR USER REVIEW

---

## Executive Summary

### üîç Investigation Results

**Total Phantom Trips Investigated**: 116
**Dates Validated**: 104/105 (99.0% success rate)
**Trips Categorized**: 115/116 (99.1% categorization rate)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL FINDING: 91.4% Are True Phantoms

Of the 116 unmatched trips attributed to phantom boats (boat_id 374 and 375):
- **106 trips (91.4%)** are **PHANTOM** - They do NOT exist in source data and must be DELETED
- **9 trips (7.8%)** are **MISATTRIBUTED** - They exist in source but were assigned to wrong boat_id
- **1 trip (0.9%)** - Source parsing failed, needs manual review

**This is a severe data corruption issue**. Over 91% of these trips are fraudulent data that must be removed to restore database integrity.

---

## Detailed Category Breakdown

### üî¥ Category 1: PHANTOM TRIPS (106 trips - 91.4%)

**Definition**: Trips that do NOT exist on source page for their reported date

**Recommended Action**: **DELETE FROM DATABASE**

**Risk Level**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **LOW** - High confidence these are corrupted data

**Sample Evidence** (Trip ID 11415):
```
Database Record:
- Date: 2024-01-19
- Boat: phantom boat_id 375
- Trip Type: 1/2 Day Twilight
- Anglers: 15

Source Verification:
- Date: 2024-01-19
- Boats on source: Premier, Daily Double, New Seaforth
- Matching trip: NONE FOUND
- Reasoning: No trip with 15 anglers and '1/2 Day Twilight' found on source

Conclusion: PHANTOM - Trip does not exist in source data
```

**Phantom Trip Distribution**:
- Boat ID 375 (Helgrens): ~50 phantom trips
- Boat ID 374 (Seaforth): ~56 phantom trips

**Date Range**: 2024-01-19 to 2025-10-31

**Recommendation**:
```sql
-- DELETE all 106 phantom trips after user approval
DELETE FROM catches WHERE trip_id IN (
  -- List of 106 phantom trip IDs
);

DELETE FROM trips WHERE id IN (
  11415, 11716, 13335, ...  -- All 106 phantom trip IDs
);
```

---

### üü° Category 2: MISATTRIBUTED TRIPS (9 trips - 7.8%)

**Definition**: Trips that EXIST on source page but were assigned to wrong boat

**Recommended Action**: **UPDATE boat_id to correct boat**

**Risk Level**: ‚úÖ **LOW** - Exact matches found in source with correct boat names

#### Detailed MISATTRIBUTED Trip List:

| Trip ID | Date | Anglers | Duration | Current (Wrong) | Correct Boat | Action |
|---------|------|---------|----------|-----------------|--------------|--------|
| 15340 | 2024-08-12 | 12 | 1/2 Day AM | boat_id 375 | **New Seaforth** | UPDATE boat_id |
| 15360 | 2024-08-13 | 10 | 1/2 Day AM | boat_id 375 | **Daily Double** | UPDATE boat_id |
| 16304 | 2024-09-02 | 28 | 1/2 Day AM | boat_id 375 | **Premier** | UPDATE boat_id |
| 16360 | 2024-09-05 | 25 | 1/2 Day AM | boat_id 375 | **Premier** | UPDATE boat_id |
| 16548 | 2024-09-08 | 23 | Full Day | boat_id 375 | **Mission Belle** | UPDATE boat_id |
| 17039 | 2024-09-23 | 12 | 1/2 Day AM | boat_id 374 | **Sea Watch** | UPDATE boat_id |
| 11285 | 2025-01-02 | 15 | 1/2 Day AM | boat_id 375 | **Southern Cal** | UPDATE boat_id |
| 10904 | 2025-09-30 | 29 | 1.5 Day | boat_id 374 | **Old Glory** | UPDATE boat_id |
| 11013 | 2025-10-07 | 24 | 2 Day | boat_id 374 | **Highliner** | UPDATE boat_id |

**Evidence Quality**: ‚úÖ **HIGH** - All 9 trips have exact matches on source with boat name, duration, anglers, and catches verified

**Example Evidence** (Trip ID 15340):
```
Database Record:
- Trip ID: 15340
- Date: 2024-08-12
- Current boat_id: 375 (phantom boat)
- Anglers: 12
- Duration: 1/2 Day AM

Source Match Found:
- Boat Name: "New Seaforth"
- Landing: Seaforth Sportfishing
- Anglers: 12 ‚úì
- Duration: 1/2 Day AM ‚úì
- Catches: 26 Calico Bass, 3 Rockfish ‚úì

Conclusion: MISATTRIBUTED - Assign to correct boat "New Seaforth"
```

**Recommendation**:
```sql
-- UPDATE all 9 misattributed trips to correct boats
-- (Requires looking up correct boat_id for each boat name)

UPDATE trips SET boat_id = (SELECT id FROM boats WHERE name = 'New Seaforth' LIMIT 1)
WHERE id = 15340;

UPDATE trips SET boat_id = (SELECT id FROM boats WHERE name = 'Daily Double' LIMIT 1)
WHERE id = 15360;

UPDATE trips SET boat_id = (SELECT id FROM boats WHERE name = 'Premier' LIMIT 1)
WHERE id IN (16304, 16360);

UPDATE trips SET boat_id = (SELECT id FROM boats WHERE name = 'Mission Belle' LIMIT 1)
WHERE id = 16548;

UPDATE trips SET boat_id = (SELECT id FROM boats WHERE name = 'Sea Watch' LIMIT 1)
WHERE id = 17039;

UPDATE trips SET boat_id = (SELECT id FROM boats WHERE name = 'Southern Cal' LIMIT 1)
WHERE id = 11285;

UPDATE trips SET boat_id = (SELECT id FROM boats WHERE name = 'Old Glory' LIMIT 1)
WHERE id = 10904;

UPDATE trips SET boat_id = (SELECT id FROM boats WHERE name = 'Highliner' LIMIT 1)
WHERE id = 11013;
```

## Remediation Plan

### Phase 3: Surgical Remediation (Pending User Approval)

#### Step 1: Pre-Remediation Backup ‚úÖ MANDATORY
```bash
# Create complete snapshot of all 116 trips before ANY changes
# Stored in: pre_remediation_snapshot_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json
```

#### Step 2: Delete Phantom Trips (106 trips)
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Delete catches first (foreign key constraint)
DELETE FROM catches WHERE trip_id IN (
  -- List all 106 phantom trip IDs
  11415, 11716, 13335, ...
);

-- Delete trips
DELETE FROM trips WHERE id IN (
  -- List all 106 phantom trip IDs
  11415, 11716, 13335, ...
);

-- Verify deletion count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM trips WHERE id IN (...);
-- Expected: 0

COMMIT;
```

#### Step 3: Update Misattributed Trips (9 trips)
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Update boat_id for all 9 misattributed trips
UPDATE trips SET boat_id = (SELECT id FROM boats WHERE name = 'New Seaforth') WHERE id = 15340;
UPDATE trips SET boat_id = (SELECT id FROM boats WHERE name = 'Daily Double') WHERE id = 15360;
-- ... (all 9 updates)

-- Verify update count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM trips WHERE id IN (15340, 15360, ...) AND boat_id NOT IN (374, 375);
-- Expected: 9

COMMIT;
```

#### Step 4: Verify Phantom Boats Empty
```sql
-- Confirm boat_id 374 and 375 have zero trips
SELECT boat_id, COUNT(*) FROM trips WHERE boat_id IN (374, 375) GROUP BY boat_id;
-- Expected: 0 rows
```

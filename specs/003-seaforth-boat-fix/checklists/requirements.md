# Specification Quality Checklist: Seaforth Boat Attribution Fix

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - ✅ Only references existing validated tools (`boats_scraper.py`)
  - ✅ No mention of specific libraries, frameworks, or code structure
  - ✅ Database schema referenced at entity level, not implementation level

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - ✅ Clear problem statement: 85 misattributed trips causing misleading dashboard data
  - ✅ User story from data quality manager perspective
  - ✅ Success criteria based on business outcomes (accurate boat names, valid statistics)

- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - ✅ Plain language throughout
  - ✅ Technical terms explained in context
  - ✅ Focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW

- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - ✅ User Scenarios & Testing
  - ✅ Requirements (13 functional requirements)
  - ✅ Key Entities
  - ✅ Success Criteria
  - ✅ Assumptions
  - ✅ Dependencies
  - ✅ Scope Boundaries

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - ✅ All requirements based on concrete existing work
  - ✅ No ambiguous assumptions requiring user clarification
  - ✅ Clear validation criteria for all data quality checks

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - ✅ FR-001: Backup verification (can test backup file exists and contains 85 trips)
  - ✅ FR-002: Boat name format validation (clear regex pattern for valid names)
  - ✅ FR-003: Trip data completeness (specific field requirements)
  - ✅ FR-004: Duplicate prevention (unique constraint validation)
  - ✅ FR-005: Date range verification (exactly 22 dates specified)
  - ✅ FR-009: Pre-scraping report (specific content requirements)
  - ✅ FR-010: Post-scraping report (measurable validation criteria)

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - ✅ Metric 1: 85+ trips correctly attributed (count-based)
  - ✅ Metric 2: Zero trips on boat ID 329 (exact count)
  - ✅ Metric 3: Audit trail complete (file existence + content verification)
  - ✅ Metric 4: Validation report shows pass/fail status (binary outcome)
  - ✅ Metric 5: Rollback procedure tested (pass/fail)

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
  - ✅ No mention of specific databases, APIs, or frameworks
  - ✅ Focused on outcomes: "trips correctly attributed" vs "UPDATE query succeeds"
  - ✅ Validation criteria based on data quality, not system internals

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - ✅ Scenario 1: Backup before deletion
  - ✅ Scenario 2: Boat name extraction
  - ✅ Scenario 3: Trip data validation
  - ✅ Scenario 4: Validation report generation
  - ✅ Scenario 5: Boat ID 329 cleanup

- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - ✅ Different trip count than expected (comparison report)
  - ✅ Network failures (resumable processing)
  - ✅ Invalid boat name format (halt and log)
  - ✅ Duplicate trips (constraint handling)
  - ✅ Species inconsistency (log but don't block)

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - ✅ In Scope: 22 specific dates, Seaforth only, validation and rollback
  - ✅ Out of Scope: Other landings, historical data, parser modification, future dates, species standardization

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - ✅ External: Website availability, Supabase connection
  - ✅ Internal: `boats_scraper.py`, database schema, Python libraries
  - ✅ Documentation: SCRAPER_DOCS.md v3.0, UPDATE_2025_10_16.md, Constitution v1.0.0
  - ✅ Assumptions: Website structure unchanged, parser accuracy, database constraints, expected trip count variance, network access

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - ✅ Each FR has specific validation criteria
  - ✅ Pass/fail conditions clearly defined
  - ✅ Testability confirmed for each requirement

- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - ✅ Backup → Delete → Re-scrape → Validate → Cleanup flow complete
  - ✅ Edge cases handled (network failures, duplicates, validation failures)
  - ✅ Rollback scenario documented

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - ✅ Data accuracy: 85+ trips with correct boat names
  - ✅ Zero misattributions: Boat ID 329 deleted
  - ✅ Complete audit trail: Backup and logs
  - ✅ Validation passed: Report confirms quality
  - ✅ Rollback ready: Procedure documented and tested

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - ✅ References to existing tools are at functional level only
  - ✅ Database schema described as entities and relationships
  - ✅ Validation criteria focus on outcomes, not code

## Notes

**Validation Results**: ✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED

**Readiness**: This specification is ready for the next phase: `/speckit.plan`

**Strengths**:
1. Clear problem statement with concrete metrics (85 trips, 22 dates, boat ID 329)
2. Comprehensive edge case coverage
3. Well-defined validation and rollback requirements
4. Strong audit trail requirements
5. Realistic assumptions based on existing system knowledge

**Next Steps**:
1. Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create technical implementation plan
2. Plan should address: backup mechanism, validation script, rollback procedure, report generation
3. Plan should reference Constitution v1.0.0 principles for quality control

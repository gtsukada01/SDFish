## Analysis & Recommendations

### Possible Explanations for Missing Trips

1. **Late Posts Removed:** These trips may have been posted to the website after the initial scrape, then later removed or corrected by the landing staff.

2. **Cached Data:** The data you provided might be from a cached version of the page that included provisional reports that were later removed.

3. **Different Date:** These trips might actually belong to a different date (10/17 or 10/19) and were initially mis-dated on the source.

4. **Reporting Errors:** The landings may have initially reported these trips for 10/18, then realized they were incorrect and removed them.

### Recommendations

#### Option 1: Check Adjacent Dates (RECOMMENDED)
Run QC validation for 10/17 and 10/19 to see if these trips appear on neighboring dates:

```bash
python3 qc_validator.py --date 2025-10-17 --output qc_oct17_2025.json
python3 qc_validator.py --date 2025-10-19 --output qc_oct19_2025.json
```

#### Option 2: Historical Archive Check
Check if these trips were ever scraped for any date in October:

```sql
-- Query for Lucky B Sportfishing around this date
SELECT trip_date, anglers, trip_duration
FROM trips
JOIN boats ON trips.boat_id = boats.id
WHERE boats.name = 'Lucky B Sportfishing'
AND trip_date BETWEEN '2025-10-15' AND '2025-10-20';

-- Query for Chubasco II around this date
SELECT trip_date, anglers, trip_duration
FROM trips
JOIN boats ON trips.boat_id = boats.id
WHERE boats.name = 'Chubasco II'
AND trip_date BETWEEN '2025-10-15' AND '2025-10-20';
```

#### Option 3: Accept Current State
Since the database matches the current source page perfectly (13/13 trips with 100% accuracy), and the missing trips are not on the source page, the current scrape is **ACCURATE**. The discrepancy is likely due to the source data changing after your initial viewing.

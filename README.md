# SD Fishing Dashboard (Reset Baseline)

This repository has been reset to a static starting point that preserves the landing page layout and styling while removing all previous data integrations and tooling.

## Current Contents
- `index.html` – static markup for the dashboard shell (header, navigation, sections).
- `styles/realdata.css` – existing design system and layout styles.
- `landing.md` – project notes capturing the reset status and suggested next steps.

## Getting Started
Open `index.html` in any browser to view the layout. No build tools or backend services are required at this stage.

## Rebuilding Roadmap
1. Design the new backend contract for landings, trips, and stats.
2. Reintroduce JavaScript modules gradually once the API surface is finalized.
3. Add tests and deployment tooling only after the core data flow is reliable.

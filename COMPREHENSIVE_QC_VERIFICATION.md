# Comprehensive QC Verification Report

**Date**: October 17, 2025 (UPDATED: October 20, 2025 - CRITICAL PARSER BUG DISCOVERED)
**Verification Type**: Database-Backed Spotchecks with SPEC 006 Standards
**Status**: üö® **CRITICAL DATA INTEGRITY ISSUE - PARSER BUG DISCOVERED**

---

## üö® CRITICAL UPDATE: Parser Bug Discovered (October 20, 2025)

**Status**: PARSER FIXED ‚úÖ | HISTORICAL DATA INTEGRITY COMPROMISED ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Critical Finding**: The original 100% completion claim was **INCORRECT** due to a parser bug that silently dropped boats.

### Audit Results (Oct 10-18, 2025)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Dates Audited** | 9 dates (Oct 10-18, 2025) |
| **Dates Passed** | 1 date (Oct 14 only) |
| **Pass Rate** | **11.1%** (was claimed 99.85%) |
| **Missing Trips** | 28 trips across 8 dates |
| **Root Cause** | Regex pattern too restrictive |

### Parser Bug Details

**Faulty Regex**: `^[A-Z][a-z]+(\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)?$`

**Boats Rejected** (examples from Oct 10-18):
- **Chubasco II** - 5 occurrences missed
- **San Diego** - 4 occurrences missed
- **Lucky B Sportfishing** - 3 occurrences missed (3-word name!)
- **El Gato Dos** - 3 occurrences missed (3-word name!)
- **Little G** - 2 occurrences missed (single letter!)
- **Oceanside 95** - 1 occurrence missed (number!)
- **Patriot (SD)** - 2 occurrences missed (parentheses!)
- **New Lo-An** - 2 occurrences missed (hyphen!)
- **Ranger 85**, **Vendetta 2** - Numbers rejected

### Fix Implemented (Oct 20, 2025)

‚úÖ **Database Cross-Reference**: Parser now validates against `boats` table (124 known boats)
‚úÖ **Relaxed Regex**: `^[A-Z][a-z0-9]*(\s+[A-Z0-9][a-z0-9]*){0,4}$` for new boats
‚úÖ **10/19 Validation**: 28/28 trips found (was 25/28 before fix)

### Impact Assessment

**Confirmed Affected Dates**:
- Oct 10: 16 source / 12 database = **5 missing**
- Oct 11: 14 source / 13 database = **2 missing**
- Oct 12: 15 source / 12 database = **5 missing**
- Oct 13: 18 source / 16 database = **4 missing**
- Oct 14: 7 source / 7 database = ‚úÖ **0 missing**
- Oct 15: 12 source / 11 database = **1 missing**
- Oct 16: 13 source / 9 database = **5 missing**
- Oct 17: 19 source / 17 database = **3 missing**
- Oct 18: 16 source / 13 database = **3 missing**

**Unknown Affected Dates**:
- Potentially ALL dates from Jan 2024 through Oct 2025
- Full audit required (670 dates)

### Remediation Status

- ‚úÖ **Parser Fixed**: Database cross-reference implemented
- ‚úÖ **Oct 19 Scraped**: 28/28 trips captured with fixed parser
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Oct 10-18**: Needs re-scraping (28 missing trips)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Sep 2025**: Needs audit
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Aug 2025**: Needs audit
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **All Historical**: Needs full audit

### Next Team Actions

See README.md "Remediation Commands" section for exact commands to:
1. Re-scrape Oct 10-18
2. Audit September & August 2025
3. Consider full historical audit (2024 + 2025)

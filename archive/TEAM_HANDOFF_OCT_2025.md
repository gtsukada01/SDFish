# Team Handoff Document - October 2025
**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Project**: Fish Scraper - San Diego Fishing Data Collection
**Status**: Parser Bug Remediation In Progress

---

## Executive Summary

### Critical Parser Bug Discovered & Fixed (Oct 20, 2025)
A **critical regex bug** in the boat name parser was silently dropping trips from the database. The bug was discovered during routine QC validation and has been **completely fixed**.

**Impact**: 43+ trips recovered so far from 2025 data
**Root Cause**: Faulty regex pattern rejected valid boat names
**Solution**: Implemented two-tier validation (database cross-reference + relaxed regex)
**Status**: Full 2025 audit currently running to identify all remaining gaps

---

## Current Status (as of Oct 22, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Completed Work

1. **Parser Bug Fixed** (Oct 20, 2025)
   - Location: `boats_scraper.py` lines 450-520
   - Fixed regex pattern to accept all valid boat names
   - Implemented database cross-reference validation (124 known boats)
   - Added relaxed fallback regex for new boats

2. **October 2025 Remediation** - 100% Complete
   - Re-scraped: Oct 10-20 with fixed parser
   - Recovered: 40 missing trips
   - QC Validation: 100% pass rate (was 11% before fix)
   - Report: `qc_oct10_20_remediation.json`

3. **January-February 2025 Remediation** - Complete
   - Re-scraped: 9 failed dates from Jan-Feb
   - Recovered: 3 additional trips (Chubasco II on Jan 10, 17, 18)
   - QC Reports: `qc_feb14_20.json`, `qc_feb21_28.json`

4. **Duplicate Detection System** - Implemented
   - Location: `qc_validator.py` lines 306-348
   - Auto-detects "Dock Totals" website duplicates
   - Automatically deletes and skips validation
   - Comprehensive logging of all skipped dates

### üîÑ In Progress

**Full 2025 QC Audit (Feb 6 - Oct 31)**
- Command: `python3 scripts/python/qc_validator.py --start-date 2025-02-06 --end-date 2025-10-31 --output qc_2025_feb_oct_audit.json`
- Status: Running in background
- Progress: Processing ~2-3 seconds per date
- Total dates: 268
- Output: Will generate complete JSON report with all failed dates

### ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps for New Team

1. **Wait for Full Audit to Complete** (~15-30 minutes from 7:28am PT)
   - Check completion: `ls -lh qc_2025_feb_oct_audit.json`
   - Review results: `cat qc_2025_feb_oct_audit.json | jq '.summary'`

2. **Re-scrape All Failed Dates**
   - Extract failed dates from audit report
   - Run batch re-scraping with fixed parser
   - Expected recovery: 10-50 additional trips

3. **Final QC Validation**
   - Re-run full 2025 audit to confirm 100% pass rate
   - Generate final completion report

4. **Consider 2024 Full Audit** (Optional)
   - 366 dates total (leap year)
   - Same parser bug may have affected 2024
   - Use same workflow as 2025 audit

## Technical Details

### The Parser Bug

**Location**: `boats_scraper.py` (old regex, now fixed)

**Faulty Pattern**:
```python
# OLD (BROKEN) - Rejected valid boat names
^[A-Z][a-z]+(\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)?$
```

**Problems**:
- ‚ùå Rejected 3+ word names: "Lucky B Sportfishing", "El Gato Dos"
- ‚ùå Rejected single letters: "Little G"
- ‚ùå Rejected numbers: "Oceanside 95", "Ranger 85"
- ‚ùå Rejected special chars: "Patriot (SD)", "New Lo-An"

**Fix** (Two-Tier Validation):
```python
# PRIMARY: Database cross-reference (124 known boats)
if boat_name in known_boats_db:
    return boat_id

# FALLBACK: Relaxed regex for new boats
^[A-Z][a-z0-9]*(\s+[A-Z0-9][a-z0-9]*){0,4}$
```

### Duplicate Detection System

**Location**: `qc_validator.py` lines 306-348

**Purpose**: Website sometimes shows wrong date's content with "Dock Totals - [wrong date]" title

**Detection Logic**:
```python
if title and "Dock Totals" in title:
    # Extract shown date from title
    # Compare to requested date
    if shown_date != requested_date:
        # Delete trips, skip validation, log everything
        return {'status': 'SKIPPED', 'reason': f'Dock Totals duplicate - shows {shown_date} content'}
```

**Known Duplicates Found**:
- Feb 6 ‚Üí shows Feb 5 content
- Feb 12 ‚Üí shows Feb 11 content
- Feb 13 ‚Üí shows Feb 12 content
- (More may be identified by full audit)

### QC Validation System (SPEC 006)

**Location**: `qc_validator.py`

**Validation Method**: Field-level comparison
- Composite key matching: Boat + Trip Type + Anglers
- Species count validation
- Landing assignment verification
- Missing boat detection
- Extra boat detection

**Usage**:
```bash
# Single date
python3 scripts/python/qc_validator.py --date 2025-10-20

# Date range
python3 scripts/python/qc_validator.py --start-date 2025-10-01 --end-date 2025-10-31 --output qc_report.json

# Polaris Supreme test (10 trips expected)
python3 scripts/python/qc_validator.py --polaris-test --output polaris_test.json
```

### Database Schema

**Tables**:
- `landings` - 15 San Diego fishing landings
- `boats` - 124 known fishing boats with landing assignments
- `trips` - Fishing trip records (7,958+ trips currently)
- `catches` - Fish catch data linked to trips

**Key Constraints**:
- Composite unique: `(boat_id, trip_date, trip_duration, anglers)`
- Foreign keys: trips ‚Üí boats, trips ‚Üí landings
- Indexes: `trip_date`, `catches` (GIN)

- **Dates Re-scraped**: Oct 10-20 (11 dates)
- **Trips Recovered**: 40 trips
- **Pass Rate Before**: 11% (1/9 dates)
- **Pass Rate After**: 100% (11/11 dates)

- **Trips Recovered**: 3 trips (Chubasco II)
- **Most trips already in DB**: Re-scraping confirmed data integrity

### Total Recovery (So Far)
- **Trips Recovered**: 43+ trips
- **Dates Fixed**: 20 dates
- **Remaining Work**: Feb-Oct 2025 audit results pending

---

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### 1. "Dock Totals" Website Duplicates

**Issue**: Website sometimes returns wrong date's content
**Detection**: Title shows "Dock Totals - [different date]"
**Solution**: Auto-detected and skipped by QC validator
**Impact**: No data loss, dates are properly marked as skipped

### 2. Chubasco II Most Common Missing Boat

**Observation**: Chubasco II appears in majority of failed QC validations
**Reason**: Frequently scheduled boat caught by old parser bug
**Status**: All identified Chubasco II trips have been recovered

### 3. Landing Header Detection

**Previous Issue**: Parser sometimes confused landing headers with boat data
**Fix**: Robust header detection in fixed parser (lines 580-600)
**Status**: Resolved

## Testing & Validation

### Polaris Supreme Validation Test

**Purpose**: Known benchmark with 10 expected trips
**Command**: `python3 scripts/python/qc_validator.py --polaris-test`
**Expected**: 10/10 trips match perfectly
**Last Result**: ‚úÖ PASSED (Oct 17, 2025)

### Progressive Validation Workflow (SPEC 006)

**Process**:
1. Scrape batch of 5-10 dates
2. QC validate immediately
3. If 100% pass ‚Üí continue to next batch
4. If failures ‚Üí investigate, fix, re-scrape
5. Final Polaris test after major work

**Benefits**:
- Early detection of parser issues
- Prevents accumulation of bad data
- Maintains 100% accuracy mandate

## Team Transition Notes

### What The New Team Should Know

1. **Parser Is Now Reliable**
   - Fixed parser has been validated on 20+ dates
   - Database cross-reference prevents future regressions
   - QC validation catches any issues immediately

2. **Full Audit Running**
   - Results will show ALL remaining gaps in 2025
   - Once complete, batch re-scraping will be straightforward
   - Expected completion: ~15-30 minutes from start time (7:28am PT)

3. **Documentation Is Comprehensive**
   - `CLAUDE_OPERATING_GUIDE.md` has step-by-step procedures
   - `COMPREHENSIVE_QC_VERIFICATION.md` documents all validation
   - `DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` explains doc governance

4. **2024 May Need Attention**
   - Same parser bug affected all dates
   - 366 dates total (leap year)
   - Consider running full 2024 audit after 2025 is complete

### Recommended First Steps

**Day 1**:
1. Review this handoff document
2. Check if `qc_2025_feb_oct_audit.json` has been generated
3. Review audit results: `cat qc_2025_feb_oct_audit.json | jq '.summary'`

**Day 2-3**:
1. Extract failed dates from audit report
2. Batch re-scrape all failed dates
3. Run final QC validation to confirm 100% coverage

**Week 2**:
1. Consider 2024 full audit (366 dates)
2. Update annual reports with final statistics
3. Plan ongoing maintenance schedule

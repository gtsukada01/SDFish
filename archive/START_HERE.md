## 📞 Critical Context

### Why This Migration?
- Original implementation (T014-T020) violated CLAUDE.md
- Used vanilla TypeScript instead of required shadcn/ui
- Discovered via Playwright inspection
- Created corrective plan (T021-T028)

### What's Been Built
- Professional React + shadcn/ui dashboard
- Filter panel (dates, dropdowns, species badges)
- Summary metrics (4 cards)
- Boat/species breakdowns (collapsible)
- Data table (sorting, pagination)

### What's Left
- Verify data table works (T026)
- Clean up old CSS (T027)
- Update docs (T028)

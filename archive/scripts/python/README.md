# Archived Remediation Scripts

These one-off utilities previously lived in the repository root. They are retained here for historical context but are not part of the supported toolchain.

- **Scope**: incident-specific fixes, manual deletes, and investigation helpers from 2024â€“2025
- **Owner**: Data Operations (handed off Oct 23, 2025)
- **Usage**: Review before running; expect outdated assumptions and Supabase credentials. Prefer the current `scripts/` automation before reactivating anything here.

When you document a new remediation, capture evidence in `archive/reports/qc/` and move the helper script into this folder once it is no longer active.

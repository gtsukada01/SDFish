## Historical Issues Resolved

### Parser Bug (Discovered Oct 20, Fixed Oct 20)
- **Issue**: Boat name regex too restrictive, potentially missing boats
- **Fix**: Database cross-reference system implemented
- **Validation**: Comprehensive audit Oct 22 shows ZERO missing boats on dates with trips
- **Conclusion**: Parser fix successfully prevented any data loss

### Ghost Data Cleanup (Oct 22, 2025)
- **Issue**: 176 trips from Oct 17-31 were scraped before dates finalized (future scraping)
- **Fix**: Deleted all 176 ghost trips, re-scraped Oct 17-21 with real data (88 trips)
- **Validation**: Comprehensive audit shows clean October data (Oct 1-21 only, no ghost data)
- **Conclusion**: Ghost data completely eliminated, data integrity restored

### April-June Remediation (Oct 22, 2025)
- **Issue**: Missing trips from parser limitations
- **Fix**: 395 trips recovered across Phases 1-4
- **Validation**: All dates now pass QC validation
- **Conclusion**: Data completeness restored

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Single Known Issue (Accepted)
- Aug 7, 2025: Dolphin boat species counts (0.14% error rate, user accepted)

### üìä Recommendations

1. ‚úÖ **Database Ready for Production**: Data quality exceeds requirements
2. ‚úÖ **Continue Oct 22-31**: Resume daily scraping with QC validation
3. ‚úÖ **Continue Nov 2025+**: Use same SPEC 006 progressive workflow
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Monitor Scraping Time**: Avoid scraping before 5pm PT to prevent ghost data
5. ‚úÖ **Archive Session Docs**: Move outdated handoff/session docs to archive/

### üóÇÔ∏è Artifact Housekeeping (Oct 23, 2025)

- Historical QC exports now live in `archive/reports/qc/`; the root directory retains only `qc_2025_full_audit.*` as the current baseline.
- Scrape summary JSONs reside in `archive/reports/scrape/`, and legacy mitigation scripts are under `archive/scripts/python/` for posterity.
- Root-level `*.log`, `qc_*.json`, `SCRAPE_*.json`, and backup dumps are ignored going forward‚Äîcapture new operational outputs inside `logs/`, `backups/`, or the archive subfolders above.
- Clean up disposable diagnostics (screenshots, HTML spikes) once linked in docs so we maintain a lightweight QC workspace.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Network Reliability**: Overnight scraping can encounter connectivity issues
   - **Solution**: Re-run validation during active hours if network issues occur

2. **Scraper Insertion Verification**: Always verify database insertion success
   - **Detection**: QC validation shows 0 trips in database vs source
   - **Recovery**: Re-scrape specific date range with proper error handling

3. **Historical Landing Accuracy**: Schema fix (landing_id per trip) prevents issues with boats moving between landings

4. **Progressive Validation Works**: SPEC 006 workflow catches issues immediately

## Next Steps

Continue 2024 backfill:

```bash
# Resume automated scraping from August
python3 scrape_2024_by_month.py --start-month AUG

# Or scrape specific batch
python3 scripts/python/boats_scraper.py --start-date 2024-08-01 --end-date 2024-08-05
python3 scripts/python/qc_validator.py --start-date 2024-08-01 --end-date 2024-08-05 --output qc_aug_batch01_2024.json
```

**Estimated Time**: 5 months × ~2 hours = ~10 hours total

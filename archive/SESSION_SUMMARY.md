- esbuild + PostCSS for building

### Build Output
- Bundle: `assets/main.js` (1.6MB)
- CSS: `assets/styles.css` (1.6KB)
- Source maps: 3.1MB (main.js.map)

### Performance
- Build time: ~250ms
- Server: http://localhost:8081
- Load time: <2s (estimated)

## 🎯 Next Steps (30-45 min to complete)

### Immediate (T026)
1. Use Playwright to verify CatchTable
   - Table structure (TableHeader, TableBody, 8 columns)
   - Sorting functionality (click headers)
   - Pagination (Previous/Next buttons)
   - Data accuracy (2 mock records)
2. Mark T026 complete

### Short-term (T027)
1. Review `styles/table.css`
2. Delete obsolete vanilla CSS
3. Verify build still works
4. Mark T027 complete

### Final (T028)
1. Update `specs/001-offshore-analytics-table/quickstart.md`
2. Add RESET timestamp to `landing.md`
3. Update Playwright test selectors if needed
4. Run full test suite
5. Mark T028 complete

### Completion
1. Final visual verification
2. Git commit with migration complete message
3. Merge to main or create PR

## 🚀 How to Resume

### Commands to Start
```bash
# Check current state
git status

## 🐛 Issues & Resolutions

### Issues Encountered
1. **Missing shadcn components** → Installed via `npx shadcn@latest add`
2. **Calendar component confusion** → Used react-day-picker (correct shadcn approach)
3. **Path alias errors** → Configured @/* aliases in tsconfig.json
4. **Build system setup** → Configured esbuild with JSX/TSX loaders

### Outstanding Issues (Non-Critical)
- ⚠️ 404 error in console (doesn't affect functionality)
- ⚠️ Browserslist outdated warning (cosmetic only)
- 🔲 T026 verification pending
- 🔲 CSS cleanup needed
- 🔲 Documentation updates needed

---

## 💡 Key Learnings

### What Worked Well
- shadcn CLI made component installation smooth
- Playwright MCP verification highly effective
- React + TypeScript + Tailwind stack is solid
- Incremental task approach (T021-T028) provided clear progress
- Comprehensive documentation aided debugging

### What to Remember
- Always verify with Playwright after each component
- shadcn components require proper configuration (components.json)
- HSL color tokens are mandatory per CLAUDE.md
- Path aliases (@/*) critical for shadcn imports
- esbuild needs explicit JSX/TSX loaders

### Recommendations for Next Team
1. Start by reading HANDOFF.md thoroughly
2. Use Playwright MCP for all verifications
3. Test incrementally (don't batch multiple changes)
4. Keep todo list updated with TodoWrite tool
5. Document any deviations immediately
